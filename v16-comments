I've reviewed all of the comments by the IESG reviewers and have made a number of edits to produce a -17 version of the draft. Not all of the comments were directly answerable so I've included some explanation below.

No. I've clarified the intent by changing the sentence to read "...for all
well-known brands..."

I think that it is more accurate to say that some of the proposed 
mechanisms either bypass or transcend the straight-forward alignment
logic.  None of them have enough momentum at this time to merit special
call-outs in section 6 (IMO).  If they progress, they will each have to
handle their own security considerations.

The reference that I had in mind was to item 3 of the first bullet in 
4.1.3.3. I've adjusted the text in 6 to now read: "Section 4.1.3.3 warns 
that rewriting the RFC5322.From header field to create an artificial 
domain name should not be done with any domain."

I added text to these sections to be more explicit about the 
conditions which lead to interoperability problems. 

In the abstract: "The use of restrictive policies through the DMARC 
framework can cause interoperability issues when messages do not flow. . ."

In the intro: " The DMARC mechanism, especially when employed with 
restrictive policies, encounters several different types of 
interoperability issues. . ."

Section 3.2.3.1 is pretty straightforward already. I did not see
a need to change the text in that section.

While mailing lists can be adversely impacted, I don't think
that they are necessarily more impacted than the other items
which are called out in the body of the document.

IMO, DMARC is causing a latent interoperabilty to become overt.
Neither component is "introducing" the problem, it is more of
a matter of revealing something that was already broken. I 
changed the text to read:

"Some common message handling strategies break the integrity of 
DKIM signatures. A restrictive DMARC policy along with a broken 
DKIM signature causes latent interoperability problems to become 
overt problems."
